I designed and developed an innovative brain-controlled wheelchair that allows users to navigate through thought alone. Utilizing EEG signals, my project employs advanced deep learning algorithms to interpret brain activity and convert it into actionable commands for the wheelchair. This system not only enhances mobility for individuals with physical disabilities but also demonstrates the potential of brain-computer interfaces in improving quality of life. By integrating a Raspberry Pi and Arduino for seamless communication, I aimed to create an accessible solution that empowers users to regain independence.
